### Original Underdog Anthem Speech: "For the Ones They Forgot"

They say you’re lucky to be here.  
Like you stumbled in.  
Like this spot belongs to someone else.

They look past your flag.  
They scroll past your name.  
They’ve already picked the winners —  
and it’s not you.

Good.

Let them forget your name.  
Let them sleep on your story.  
Because when the whistle blows —  
you’ll remind the world how hunger plays.

You didn’t come for a handshake.  
You came for a fight.  
For every kid who played barefoot on dirt pitches,  
for every goal scored where no one was watching,  
for every time they said you weren’t enough —  
**you’re here to answer.**

And you don’t owe anyone an apology for that.

You earned this.

But the work?  
The work starts now.  
Now, you have to **outrun** them.  
**Outfight** them.  
**Outbelieve** them.  
You have to win every ball like it’s life or death —  
because out here, it is.

And when your lungs are burning,  
when the legs feel like stone,  
when you think there’s nothing left —  
**dig**.

Because that place —  
the one just past breaking point —  
**that’s where the champions live**.

This isn’t just your time.  
This is your proof.  
That heart beats hype.  
That fight beats fame.  
That forgotten teams can become unforgettable.

So say it with your chest —  
not just for you,  
but for the ones they forgot:

**We’re here.  
We belong.  
And we will not be ignored.**
