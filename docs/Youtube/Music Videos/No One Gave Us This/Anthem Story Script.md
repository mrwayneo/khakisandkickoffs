**Title: No One Gave Us This – Anthem Story Script (4-Min Narrative Cut)**  
_Theme: Underdog Journey of a Young American Footballer_

---

**[0:00 – Opening beat + fade in spoken narration]**  
_Soft piano, ambient strings. Stadium noise slowly fades in._

**Narrator (voiceover):**  
_"In a country where football means helmets and touchdowns…_  
_…he dared to chase a different dream."_

**[0:08 – Song intro begins: spoken word section of anthem]**

We see **a young boy (8–10 years old)** dribbling a weathered soccer ball alone on a dusty field.  
He’s in cheap sneakers, kicking between broken cones.  
His parents argue in the kitchen in the background — a TV showing NFL highlights.

**Dad (muffled):**  
_“There’s no future in soccer here. He should be playin’ real sports.”_

**Mom (tired):**  
_“He needs a chance, not a fantasy.”_

**[0:40 – Spoken intro ends / Verse 1 begins]**

**Visuals match the lyrics:**

- Close-up of muddy shoes, determination in his eyes.
    
- He trains alone. Runs drills. Misses goals. Tries again.
    

**[1:05 – Pre-Chorus]**

He sees older kids laughing at him. They throw a football past his goal.  
He keeps going. Even when he’s out of breath. Even when it hurts.

**[1:20 – Chorus #1]**

The ball hits the net. For the first time — clean, perfect.  
He smiles. Looks around. No one's there. But that goal _mattered_.

**[1:35 – Flash montage:**]

- Years pass. He’s older now (around 16).
    
- Other kids start joining him.
    
- A local coach notices.
    
- He gets scouted. Wears his first USA kit.
    
- Shots of rejection letters… then finally, an acceptance.
    

**[1:55 – Verse 2 (rap-style)**]  
Training montages: stadium lights, lifting weights, juggling drills, sprints in the rain.  
His room shows a tacked-up poster: _“2026 – Our Year”_

**[2:20 – Pre-Chorus (brief narration fade-in)**]  
_“They didn’t believe. Not in him. Not in the team. Not in this dream._  
_But belief isn't something you get. It's something you build.”_

**[2:40 – Chorus #2]**  
Matchday.  
The tunnel.  
**USA vs [any top-tier team] – FIFA World Cup Final 2026.**

He hears the anthem.  
Camera zooms in.  
Tears in his eyes.

**[2:58 – Music softens briefly – flash to memory montage]**

- His mom watching on TV, hand over her heart.
    
- His dad alone in a truck, yelling, _“That’s my boy!”_
    

**[3:09 – Bridge / Spoken]**

_“We fight for every inch. We run for every kid who was told it wasn’t possible.”_

**[3:20 – Final Chorus (slow motion match scenes)**]

- He tackles, scores, celebrates.
    
- The crowd roars.
    
- USA players embrace. No one can believe it.
    

**[3:29 – Outro “We earned this” refrain begins]**

Cut to black screen with bold white words:  
**“We earned this.”**

**[3:40 – Final shots (vocal chant continues)**]

- Dirt field.
    
- Kids now playing soccer everywhere.
    
- A young boy scores. Looks up.
    

**Final frame: the original boy, now grown, smiles as a coach hands the next kid a ball.**

**[3:55 – Fade to black. Music ends.]**
