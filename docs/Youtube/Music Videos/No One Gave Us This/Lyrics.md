**Title: No One Gave Us This**  
_(FIFA World Cup Underdog Anthem)_

---

**[Spoken Intro – cinematic, inspired by "For the Ones They Forgot"]**

They said we were lucky.  
That we were just filling space.  
They scrolled past our names.  
Ignored our flags.

But they forgot something:  
**We earned this.**

We didn’t come to trade jerseys.  
We came to fight.  
To outrun, outwork, outbleed every name they already crowned.

So when the whistle blows —  
remember who you play for:  
The kids in dirt fields.  
The teams they forgot.  
The ones who never gave up.

**This is our moment.**  
Now we show them how hunger plays.

**[Verse 1]**

Mud on the boots, lights in the eyes  
Crowd's going wild but it’s do or die  
Came from nothing, built from fire  
We climb, we claw, we never tire

---

**[Pre-Chorus]**

We break, we mend  
We lose, we bend  
But every step  
We rise again

---

**[Chorus]**

They didn’t think we’d last —  
Now we’re burning past  
Every “no” they gave  
Built the path we paved

With the whole world watching  
Hearts steady, breath tight  
We’re not here by chance  
We’re here to fight

---

**[Verse 2 – Rap Style]**

Backs to the wall, pressure in the veins  
No crowd can cheer away the pain  
We bled for this, trained for this  
Long nights — no fame in this

Underdogs with thunder calls  
Rising where the giants fall  
We ain’t flash — we’re foundation  
We ain’t hype — we’re dedication

---

**[Bridge – Spoken, final charge]**

When your lungs burn… run.  
When your legs give in… dig.  
Because just past the pain —  
**that’s where the champions live.**

So play for the ones they forgot.  
And when you scream your anthem —  
Scream like you’re never going home.

---

**[Final Chorus – Double + Crowd Chant]**

They didn’t think we’d last —  
Now we’re burning past  
Every “no” they gave  
Built the path we paved

With the whole world watching  
Hearts steady, breath tight  
We’re not here by chance  
We’re here to fight
